  Description : 

  This project simulates an interactive experience inspired by the famous TV show Fort Boyard. Players form a team, participate in various challenges, and earn keys to unlock the treasure room. The goal is to collect three keys by solving riddles, mathematical puzzles, or other games of logic and chance.
  
  Key Features :

  Team Creation: Add players with roles and assign a team leader.
  
  Diverse Challenges: Includes math puzzles, logic games, chance-based challenges, and Père Fouras’s riddles.
  
  Attempt Management: Players have a limited number of attempts to complete challenges.
  
  Progress Tracking: Players collect keys to unlock new stages.
  
  Technologies used : 

  Programming Language: Python
  
  Libraries:
  	json: Manages data for riddles and configuration.
	random: Used for challenge and riddle selection.
 
  Development Tools: PyCharm
  
  Installation : 
  
  How to use :

2. Technical documentation :

o Game algorithm : 

The game algorithm follows these steps:

1.The game begins with an introduction to its rules and objectives.
2.Players form a team and designate one leader. Each player has a defined role.
3.The team selects and completes various challenges, each offering the opportunity to earn a key upon success.
4.Once the team has collected three keys, they gain access to the treasure room.
5.The game ends when the players enter the treasure room, symbolizing victory.

o Functions: 

§ Provide a list of function prototypes, including brief descriptions of their 
roles and parameter explanations. 

o Input and error management : 

§ Describe how the code handles input values, intervals, and the methods 
used for error management. 

§ Provide a list of known bugs. 

3. Logbook

o A logbook can help keep track of project progress and task allocation: 

§ Project chronology: Dates and descriptions of milestones, decisions 
made, and problems encountered. 
§ Task distribution: Who worked on what and how tasks were divided 
among team members. 

4. Testing and Validation

o Test strategies : 

§ Specific test cases and results. 
§ Screenshots showing the tests in action.
